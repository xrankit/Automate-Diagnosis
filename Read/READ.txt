In such unprecedented times, with a fragile healthcare infrastructure, 
the medical facilities for people are scarce and even fewer for people
 with special needs. The healthcare sector got so pre-occupied with 
Covid-19 cases that people with other ailments didn't even get a 
chance to avail medical assistance. 

In India everyday many humans are affected because the patient are not
 timely and properly and also for real time conventional parameters are
 not efficiently work on different situations, frequently check-up for 
patient condition also not possible. To overcome these kind of 
situations, our system is beneficial. Our system is designed to be used
 in Home or hospital for measuring and monitoring various parameter 
like ECG, Body temperature and Blood pressure. By using new technology
 IOT integration with Machine Learning makes all objects interconnected 
and it has been recognized as the next technical revolution. The results 
can be recorded using Raspberry Pi4 displayed on a our app or Website. 
Relatives, patients or Doctors can login to a website and view those 
results


The objective of developing monitoring systems is to reduce health care 
costs by reducing physician office visits, hospitalizations, and 
diagnostic testing procedure.
