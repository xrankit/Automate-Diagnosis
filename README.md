# Automate-Diagnosis
A sizeable segment of the world's population lacks access to quality healthcare. The success of healthcare ultimately depends on the doctor's skill. In this study, we investigate if this knowledge may be represented as an information corpus, or as data that has been retrieved using data mining methods, particularly the Machine Learning & Deep Learning Model, to make a diagnosis. When the medical diagnosis is made widely available, coverage increase and life quality improve. In order to determine whether inferences about the causes of various diseases can be made from the data, this paper provides an overview of machine learning approaches used in the classification of various diseases.
